      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>My name is Cody Swann and I am a junior at Mississippi State University in Computer Engineering. This is my dissection project for Embedded Systems (ECE 4724).
      </p> The device that I chose is the Onn Mini Rugged Bluetooth Speaker. I chose this speaker because of its compact design, its use of wireless audio technology, and my interest in understanding how consumer electronic products manage power, signal processing, and connectivity in small packages.</p>

        <h2>4. Product Operation</h2>
  <p>
    This section describes useful information related to how the Onn Mini Rugged Speaker operates, including diagrams of user interaction, modes, and waveform samples collected from the PCB.
  </p>

  <h3>User Interface</h3>
  <p>
    The speaker has three user-facing buttons: a volume up (<code>+</code>) button, a volume down (<code>-</code>) button, and a power button. These buttons allow the user to power the speaker on or off, control media playback, and adjust volume. A short press of the power button pauses or resumes playback, while a long press powers off the device. Audio feedback and a small internal LED help confirm actions like power-on or Bluetooth pairing.
  </p>

  <h3>User Operation Diagram</h3>
  <p>
    The following diagram shows the general flow of user interaction with the speaker, including power control, Bluetooth pairing, playback, and shutdown behavior.
  </p>
  <img src="images/User_Operation.png" alt="User Operation Diagram" class="centered-img" />

  <h3>Mode Display Diagram</h3>
  <p>
    The speaker uses a basic internal LED indicator and audio feedback tones to indicate operational modes. These include power-on, pairing mode, connected, and low battery warnings. The following diagram summarizes the indicators associated with each mode.
  </p>
  <img src="images/Mode_Display.png" alt="Mode Display Diagram" class="centered-img" />

  <h3>Waveforms</h3>
  <p>
    The following waveforms were taken directly from test points on the speaker’s internal PCB while the device was powered on and operating. These highlight signal behavior associated with audio processing and system states.
  </p>

  <h4>Initial Audio Output (Music Playback)</h4>
  <p>
    This waveform shows the amplified output from the audio amplifier chip during typical playback of music. It features a clean sine/square composite that indicates a standard audio signal.
  </p>

  <h4>Bluetooth Pairing Pulse</h4>
  <p>
    This waveform was captured during the speaker’s Bluetooth pairing process. It shows repeated digital pulses from the Bluetooth SoC, corresponding to advertising packets sent for discovery by nearby devices.
  </p>

  <h4>Button Press Detection</h4>
  <p>
    A brief pulse waveform is generated on the microcontroller’s GPIO pins when any of the three buttons are pressed. These digital transitions are debounced and processed to differentiate between short and long presses.
  </p>

  <h4>Shutdown Sequence</h4>
  <p>
    During power-down, a distinctive drop in logic level is observed across power management IC outputs, with a brief shutdown tone generated by the audio amp before complete voltage drop-off.

    <section id="analysis">
           <h2>7. Product Analysis</h2>
            <p>The speaker contains multiple subsystems including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Power management:</strong> IP4056 (battery charging IC)</li>
                <li><strong>Audio amplification:</strong> LTK5302 chip</li>
                <li><strong>Bluetooth module:</strong> ATS2853</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are approximately:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>~16 capacitors/resistors near the IP4056</li>
                <li>~18 around the LTK5302</li>
                <li>~24 near the ATS2853</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Example cost breakdown: if each passive component averages $0.01 and there are 58, that totals ~$0.58 in passives.</p>
        </section>
    

    <section id="reassembly">
        <h2>Reassembly</h2>
        <p>Once the internal components were examined and photographed, the speaker was reassembled. The power button was tested and the speaker successfully powered on, reconnected to Bluetooth, and played audio as expected.</p>

    <section id="lessons">
        <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
             <p>This project provided a hands-on understanding of embedded system integration in consumer electronics. Key takeaways included PCB trace routing, system-level design around microcontrollers, and power/audio management.</p>
